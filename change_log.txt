Oct 25 2025
- some work on deduplication code 

----------------------------------
Oct 24 2025
- did some initial testing on moving the project over to my new Nvidia DGX Spark
- added run_dgx_spark.sh for filter_humans.py and adjusted the python script to force gpu usage 
Interestingly 'sh script.sh' fails on Ubuntu due to path issues as it calls a different shell.

todo 
- adapt and test laptop_collector on the spark 

----------------------------------
Oct 19 2025
- switched to the 'm' model for filter_humans.py to get more accurate results. 

'm' medium sized model is still crazy fast on my nvidia 4000 ada. 
----------------------------------
Oct 8 2025
- finished + tested filter_humans code 

I might have to try bumping up the model size - for this filter. 
looks like there were a lot of human shots that it didn't detect 

----------------------------------
Oct 7 2025
- readme updates 
- started working on a additional filter for data_preprocessing

the data_collection programs have worked quite well but I'd like to filter 
people out of the data set before I go further. 

----------------------------------
Sept 29 2025
- initial client and server apps for data collection

serve is designed for a nvidia environment. I'd like to see how it runs on cpu and amd igpu (if possible)
